Description: Wayland EGL External Platform library -- development files
 This is a work-in-progress implementation of a EGL (Embedded-System
 Graphics Library) External Platform library to add client-side Wayland
 support to EGL on top of EGLDevice and EGLStream families of extensions.
 .
 This library implements an EGL External Platform interface to work along
 with EGL drivers that support the external platform mechanism. More
 information about EGL External platforms and the interface can be found at:
